- ## How to install MySQL 
We can use MySQL DATABASE through variuso method. We can  either download MySQL workbench or XAMPP and use MySQL Database. In This article we are going to stick with XAMPP instead of MySQL workbench 

---
### You can downlaod XAMPP 
---
* Go to the official website\
   [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)
* Choose your operating system(in my case its Wondows so i will choose Windows ) 
  
* After download of XAMPP installer run that exe file.

(By default, this process will install everything under C:\XAMPP)

## Verify XAMPP Installation 
Once XAMPP has been successfully installed, the base tables have been initialized and we manually have to start server(Don't worry we are going to do that later). You can verify your installation by going to the drive where u installed xampp and search there a Directory named XAMPP. 

Now to start the server You can open that XAMPP folder and you can found XAMPP-control.exe there. Run that exe file. 

You wil get this pannel
